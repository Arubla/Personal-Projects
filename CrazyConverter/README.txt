The goal of this program is to demonstrate good encapsulation and UI isolation
in a silly converter program. The program will take measurements from a user
and return a conversion related to some silly item, like baseball bats, school
buses, the moon, etc.

-the program will allow the user to specify what unit of measurement they are
using when they enter the number

- the program will allow the user to specify what dimension they are referring
to (distance, weight, height, etc). The program will have a set of objects
for each dimension.
