I want an app that keeps all my review materials: prayer text, audio files, and support images,
in one place. It would be great if I could read along with the audio file that sings the prayers, karaoke-style.

It sorts all my materials by lineage, then by individual practice.

I have an individual account, that links me to a database where the content is.
My account has unique access to the teachings that I've received. An administrator
can grant access to new practices as I learn them.

The app has a meditation timer.

My account has the ability to let me set and save practice routines, or generate them randomly from a
list every day.
